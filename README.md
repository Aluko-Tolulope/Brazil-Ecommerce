### Tools 
- Microsoft Power Bi 

### Data Cleaning and Exploration
In the initial data preparation stage, we performed the following tasks
- Checked the values and data quality to identify missing data, inconsistencies and Outliers.
- Carried out cross verification checks and logical checks
- Discovery of insights such as Seasonal Trends,Product performance and consumer behaviours

### Data Cleaning and Vizualisation
In this stage, the following steps were applied
- Using Power Query where proper column data types were validated appropriately
- The "Use First Row as Header" action were applied in tables where they were needed
- Text column were formatted to allow for Proper cases and promote readability
- Duplicates were removed where appicable
- Redundant and irrelevant columns were removed where applicable
### Data Modelling
Thr data for this analysis is found in different tables as refrences are made earlier to the table names and the data dictionary explaining what each table contains. The tables were connected using the merge function and connecting them with the use of the primary and foreign keys found in each of the table to detect their connectivity.
I created a new table that I labelled "Consolidated" which source was Olist_order to Olist_customer and the other tables were connected using the keys such as "order_id", "Seller_id", Customer_id while the geolocation table was connected using the Zip_code_prefix

### Data Visualization 

This was done using DAX concepts(Calculated measures, Calculated column,etc), Visuals/Charts,Filters and slicers etc in Power BI

### 1: What is the total Revenue generated and how it has changed over time?
The total revenue generated by Olist E-commerce Store between September 2016 & September 2018 is $18,066,642.56 ($18 million). This was gotten by calculating the sum of the price for orders that are delivered using the DAX calculated measure shown below
``` Total Revenue =
                SUM
                  (Consolidated[olist_order_items_dataset.price.1]);
```


### 2: What is the total transactions made over time?
The total transactions made on the Olist E-commerce Store between  2016 and 2018 totals 165649 (16 thousand transactions). This was done by counting the order ID
``` Total Transactions =
                    COUNT
                        (Consolidated[order_id])
```

### 3: What is the average amount spent on the Ecommerce- website?
Taking a look at the consumer behaviour to understand the the average amout spent on the website. This was gotten by calculating the Average of the data_ price which gave the reseult as $109.62. We arrived at this answer by writing this code 
```
Average Amount Spent =
                  AVERAGE
                        (Consolidated[olist_order_items_dataset.price])
```
### 4: What is the highest amount spent on the ecommerce Website?
We also observed that the purchase and price of products varies and wanting to know what came about the highest spend on the website which amounts to $6.74k. This was determined by identifiying 
```
    Highest Amount Spent =
                    MAX(Consolidated
      [olist_order_items_dataset.price.1])
```
### 5: What is the total number of Customers on the Ecommerce Website?
The total number of unique customers represented in the dataset is 99,441. This figure was determined by counting the distinct values within the 'customer_id' column after filtering out any null or duplicate entries. 
```Total Customers =
             DISTINCTCOUNT
          (Consolidated[customer_id])
```

A comprehensive analysis of the seller dataset revealed a total of 3,096 unique sellers operating on the Brazilian ecommerce platform during the investigated period (2016-2018).
